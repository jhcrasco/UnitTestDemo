[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/jhcrasco/UnitTestDemo/branch/main/graph/badge.svg?token=CTWQFVT2ZN)](https://codecov.io/gh/jhcrasco/UnitTestDemo)

This is a sample application that demonstrates how to integrate Bitrise, GitHub, and Codecov for continuous integration and code coverage analysis.

## Getting Started

To get started, you'll need to:

1. Clone the repository onto your local machine.
2. Follow the instructions in the Bitrise [documentation](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/en/testing/measuring-your-code-coverage-with-codecov.html) to set up a Bitrise and Codecov account and configure your project.
3. Push changes to your GitHub repository and watch as Bitrise runs your automated tests and Codecov analyzes your code coverage.
